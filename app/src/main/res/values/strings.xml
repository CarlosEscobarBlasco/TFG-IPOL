    <string name="LoremIpsum">In any digital image, the measurement of the three observed color values at each pixel is subject to some perturbations. These perturbations are due to the random nature of the photon counting process in each sensor. The noise can be amplified by digital corrections of the camera or by any image processing software. For example, tools removing blur from images or increasing the contrast enhance the noise.

The principle of the first denoising methods was quite simple: Replacing the color of a pixel with an average of the colors of nearby pixels. The variance law in probability theory ensures that if nine pixels are averaged, the noise standard deviation of the average is divided by three. Thus, if we can find for each pixel nine other pixels in the image with the same color (up to the fluctuations due to noise) one can divide the noise by three (and by four with 16 similar pixels, and so on). This looks promising, but where can these similar pixels be found?

The most similar pixels to a given pixel have no reason to be close at all. Think of the periodic patterns, or the elongated edges which appear in most images. It is therefore licit to scan a vast portion of the image in search of all the pixels that really resemble the pixel one wants to denoise. Denoising is then done by computing the average color of these most resembling pixels. The resemblance is evaluated by comparing a whole window around each pixel, and not just the color.
